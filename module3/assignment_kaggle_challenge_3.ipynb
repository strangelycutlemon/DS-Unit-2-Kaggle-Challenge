    "- [ ] Use scikit-learn for hyperparameter optimization with RandomizedSearchCV.\n",
    "- [ ] Submit your predictions to our Kaggle competition. (Go to our Kaggle InClass competition webpage. Use the blue **Submit Predictions** button to upload your CSV file. Or you can use the Kaggle API to submit your predictions.)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Doing\n",
    "- In additon to `RandomizedSearchCV`, scikit-learn has [`GridSearchCV`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html). Another library called scikit-optimize has [`BayesSearchCV`](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/notebooks/sklearn-gridsearchcv-replacement.html). Experiment with these alternatives.\n",
    "- _[Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do)_ discusses options for \"Grid-Searching Which Model To Use\" in Chapter 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can even go further in combining GridSearchCV and Pipeline: it is also possible to search over the actual steps being performed in the pipeline (say whether to use StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler). This leads to an even bigger search space and should be considered carefully. Trying all possible solutions is usually not a viable machine learning strategy. However, here is an example comparing a RandomForestClassifier and an SVC ...\n",
    "\n",
    "The example is shown in [the accompanying notebook](https://github.com/amueller/introduction_to_ml_with_python/blob/master/06-algorithm-chains-and-pipelines.ipynb), code cells 35-37. Could you apply this concept to your own pipelines?\n"

    "\n",
    "**1.** The article **[Categorical Features and Encoding in Decision Trees](https://medium.com/data-design/visiting-categorical-features-and-encoding-in-decision-trees-53400fa65931)** mentions 4 encodings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **\"Categorical Encoding\":** This means using the raw categorical values as-is, not encoded. Scikit-learn doesn't support this, but some tree algorithm implementations do. For example, [Catboost](https://catboost.ai/), or R's [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html) package.\n",
    "- **Numeric Encoding:** Synonymous with Label Encoding, or \"Ordinal\" Encoding with random order. We can use [category_encoders.OrdinalEncoder](https://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/ordinal.html).\n",
    "- **One-Hot Encoding:** We can use [category_encoders.OneHotEncoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/onehot.html).\n",
    "- **Binary Encoding:** We can use [category_encoders.BinaryEncoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/binary.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2.** The short video \n",
    "**[Coursera — How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers — Concept of mean encoding](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/competitive-data-science/concept-of-mean-encoding-b5Gxv)** introduces an interesting idea: use both X _and_ y to encode categoricals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Category Encoders has multiple implementations of this general concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [CatBoost Encoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/catboost.html)\n",
    "- [James-Stein Encoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/jamesstein.html)\n",
    "- [Leave One Out](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/leaveoneout.html)\n",
    "- [M-estimate](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/mestimate.html)\n",
    "- [Target Encoder](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/targetencoder.html)\n",
    "- [Weight of Evidence](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/categorical-encoding/woe.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Category Encoder's mean encoding implementations work for regression problems or binary classification problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "For multi-class classification problems, you will need to temporarily reformulate it as binary classification. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "encoder = ce.TargetEncoder(min_samples_leaf=..., smoothing=...) # Both parameters > 1 to avoid overfitting\n",
    "X_train_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X_train, y_train=='functional')\n",
    "X_val_encoded = encoder.transform(X_train, y_val=='functional')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3.** The **[dirty_cat](https://dirty-cat.github.io/stable/)** library has a Target Encoder implementation that works with multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    " dirty_cat.TargetEncoder(clf_type='multiclass-clf')\n",
    "```\n",
    "It also implements an interesting idea called [\"Similarity Encoder\" for dirty categories](https://www.slideshare.net/GaelVaroquaux/machine-learning-on-non-curated-data-154905090).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it seems like dirty_cat doesn't handle missing values or unknown categories as well as category_encoders does. And you may need to use it with one column at a time, instead of with your whole dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. [Embeddings](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/embeddings)** can work well with sparse / high cardinality categoricals.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**I hope it’s not too frustrating or confusing that there’s not one “canonical” way to encode categorcals. It’s an active area of research and experimentation! Maybe you can make your own contributions!**_"
